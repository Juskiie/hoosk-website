# My personal website source code! 
I'm making this public so others may potentially learn from my experience!

## Background
I wanted to create a personal website for a long time, as something I could use for my CV, and for other professional reasons.
Most of my time learning to become a software engineer I've focused on more application focused languages such as Java, and scripting languages like Python.
So, to become a more well-rounded programmer I've put in some time to becoming a web developer too!

## What was used?
In summary, I chose to use Vite and tailwindcss as my primary tools for building the applicaiton.
Tailwind allows for faster production and testing of UI changes, by solving a common problem I would encounter with vanilla CSS.
Typically, vanilla CSS would involve using global stylesheet files and manually entering rules for all my classes, but with tailwind, a lot of that work is done already and the class names just need to be used and built.
It also helps keep file size down, and as I was hosting these changes using AWS Amplify, this was a key factor.

However, my reasoning for choosing Vite over something like React or Vue, was more so experimentation than having a practical reason.
I did however find it rather intuitive to use, and had no real issues building my code with it.
Down the line I hope to better utilise some of the features of Vite.

## About me
I am not a (good) web developer. Most of my experience comes from languages like Java and Python, and while frameworks for building web apps exists for those, I have never really experimented much with them yet.
That being said, this project has been a good learning opportunity for me to enhance my skillset and diversify my options.
However, please don't use this project to actually make anything. Not because I'm going to get mad that you used my code, but because better solutions likely exist. This is just what I ended up doing.
